One  hack  is  stepping  back  and  looking  at  previous  bits  of 
suffering  I’ve  had  in  my  life.  I  write  them  down.  “Last  time 
you  broke  up  with  somebody,  last  time  you  had  a  business 
failure, last time you had a health issue, what happened?” I 
can  trace  the  growth  and  improvement  that  came  from  it 
years later.
I have another hack I use for minor annoyances. When they 
happen, a part of me will instantly react negatively. But I’ve 
learned to mentally ask myself, “What is the positive of this 
situation?”
“Okay, I’ll be late for a meeting. But what is the benefit to me? 
I get to relax and watch the birds for a moment. I’ll also spend 
less time in that boring meeting.” There’s almost always some-
thing positive.
Even if you can’t come up with something positive, you can say, 
“Well, the Universe is going to teach me something now. Now 
I get to listen and learn.”

or look at someone running by and say, “He’s out of shape, and 
I’m in be!er shape than him.”
If I saw a guy with a bad hair day, I would at first think “Haha, 
he has a bad hair day.” Well, why am I laughing at him to make 
me feel be!er about myself? And why am I trying to make me 
feel be!er about my own hair? Because I’m losing my hair, and
